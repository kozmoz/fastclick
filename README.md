"Fast" JavaScript Click Event
=============================

When working on a web app for touch devices, you will soon notice that click events are rather slow to fire.
There is a delay due to the fact that the device waits for the user to complete a gesture before deciding that the intended gesture was in fact a click.

I wrote a simple script that detects whether the device is touched without moving. This alternative "fastclick" event fires much faster.
